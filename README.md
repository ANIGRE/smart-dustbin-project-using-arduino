# smart-dustbin-project-using-arduino
A smart dustbin using an Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor.
This project is all about how you can make a smart dustbin at home just using minumum of 5 or 6 things.

Have you ever wondered you can make a smart dustbin for your home.

Just take a look at this project.

In this project I use Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic sensor, jumper wires, servo motor, thread, a small steel washer and a dustbin.

steps:

1. Take Arduino uno, Ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, Jumper wires, 9v battery and dustbin box.

2. Connect servo motor yellow pin(signal pin) to Arduino digital pin no. 9

3. Connect servo +Vcc pin to Arduino +5V pin.

4. Connect servo GND pin to Arduino GND pin.

5. Take Ultrasonic sensor connect sensor TRIG pin to Arduino pin no. 2.

6. Connect sensor ECHO pin to Arduino pin no. 3.

7. Connect servo at the top of Dustbin with the help of glue gun.

8. Connect washer and thread to the dustbin box.

9. Make a hole infront of dustbin box and fit ultrasonic sensor as shown in image.

10. Upload the code.

11. Power the Arduino with a 9V battery.
